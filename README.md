# Flavortown
Flavortown is my first React application, and allows users to search through thousands of recipes to build a customized list. Users can add or delete recipes from their list.

## Getting Started
You must have Node and NPM installed to access this application locally. Navigate to the project's server folder in your terminal and run the following command:
```
npm run start
```
This will boot up the application in your preferred web browser.

## Built With
-React and Redux
